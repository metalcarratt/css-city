# CSS-City

The goal of CSS-City is to use CSS to create a city. At the moment it supports styling individual buildings in "mission mode", but
the ultimate goal would be the ability to create custom building parts, buildings, and styles, and then place them in a city.

The aim of CSS-City is to teach CSS, or at least being a sandbox place where kids (or anyone learning CSS) can come to try out
their CSS skills in a fun environment.
